# My Personal Site and blog

Created as my personal website and blog. An opportunity for me to write things down motivated by the following quote: "If you have a thought but cannot express it then you don't really have that thought!"

### Development

Run the following code in bash script to load site:

```
    sudo apt-get install jekyll
    bundle exec jekyll serve
```
