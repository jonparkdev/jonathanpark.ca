I think I have redone my portfolio website 4 or 5 times. I can probably go back into my git history
if you really must know but for brevity, there has been many iterations.The point being there have
been many iterations each iteration was fueled by wanting to learn something new.

I can remember version 1. It was that first portfolio project a new programmer creates when they
#learn2code. It was nice to discover I still have the details of the project posted on my LinkedIn
(which I should really update). As the image above describes, it was a static HTML and CSS site
([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) hosted on GitHub Pages since I had absolutely no idea how to host
a website. As simple as this website was, I can not begin to describe how pivotal version 1 was in
helping me get my first job.

When I started working at my very first software job, I was introduced to
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). Now that I was "real" web developer with a couple months under my
belt, I had to get with the times and ditch my static website. I began by registering the domain
name _jonathanpark.ca_ and went ahead and converted all the code to React. Being a little over
zealous, I proceeded to do another refactor to the React derivative framework
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). **_Domain name_**, check! **_Shiny website built with a modern
JavaScript framework_**, check! It was time for me to move away from Github Pages and deploy all
these newly minted changes to the cloud. So I went with the most user friendly cloud provider
[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

I then was motivated to start blogging and I wanted to create for myself a nice writing and
publishing experience. This led me to look into "headless" content management systems (CMS). Think
the aesthetics of a [Medium](https://medium.com) blog with the publishing power of
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) but without all that PHP stuff. I still wanted full control over
the design of my site so I found [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). After all the work I did to get my
React website to interface with the Ghost publishing system, I did not end up blogging much. And
when I did write, I realized I did not need some fancy CMS. Not much value was added to my
experience. In the end, I am developer. Markdown, Github and an IDE all I need.

Now we are all caught up. The current version of my website is the very thing that you are reading
this article on.

That means your computer has made a request by propagating an electric signal that has made the long
journey all the way into my home to underneath my desk. Isn't that cool!

I'm not yet comfortable to teach the concepts needed to deploy this but at a high level here are the
the things I have learned:

Lesson to all new developers: **_build a portfolio site and put it on the internet, it does not
matter how simple it is_**. As I mentioned in my previous
[post](/blog/2021/02/14/setting-up-a-homelab), my goal is to try to extract some nuggets of advice
from my journey so far that could be useful to up an coming developers.

The Lesson... My website was my first project. It has been through many iterations. It started as
something simple but the more things I learn, I can apply to the website.

The lesson, its natural to want to do complicated projects. Especially with the pressure of trying
to get a job. But I think its important to start with something simple. Something that you can
finish. Something that you can be proud of. Something that you can show off. Something that you can
learn from. Something that you can build on.
