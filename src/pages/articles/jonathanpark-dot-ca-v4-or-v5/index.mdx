I think I have redone my portfolio website 4 or 5 times. Each iteration usually fueled by wanting to
learn something new.

I can remember creating version 1. It was the portfolio project that any new programmer creates when
they #learn2code. As the image above highlights (_my LinkedIn really needs an update_), it was a
static HTML and CSS site ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) hosted on GitHub Pages since I had
absolutely no idea how to host a website. As simple as this website was, I can not begin to describe
how pivotal version 1 was in helping me get my first job.

When I started working at my very first software job, I was introduced to
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). Since I was a "real" web developer with a couple months under my
belt, I had to get with the times and ditch my static website. I began by registering the domain
name _jonathanpark.ca_ and went ahead and converted all the code to React. Getting a little over
zealous, I proceeded to do another refactor to the React derivative framework
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). Now that I had a **domain name** :white_check_mark: and a **shiny
website built with a modern JavaScript framework** :white_check_mark:, it was time for me to move
away from Github Pages and deploy all these newly minted changes to the cloud. So I went with the
most user friendly cloud provider [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

After living off [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) my first year of coding, I was
motivated to start blogging. Instead of actually doing the writing that is required to publish a
blog, I needed to create the perfect writing and publishing experience. I am a developer after all,
I can't just use an out of box solution. This led me to look into "headless" content management
systems (CMS). Think the aesthetics of [Medium](https://medium.com) with the publishing power of
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) but without all that PHP stuff. There were many different options
but I decided to try out [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). I spent quite a bit of time wiring up my React
site to interface with Ghost... but as expected, I did not end up blogging. When I did write, I came
to the realization I did not need some fancy CMS. I am a developer after all. Markdown, Github and
an IDE is all I need :wink:.

Other than some small/irrellevant details in the journey, we are all caught up to present day. The
current version of jonathanpark.ca is the very thing that you are reading this article on. It's
nothing special. It's just a NextJS template from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), which is the
CSS framework I use to make things look nice. In the experience I have gathered, designing something
myself usually drives me crazy so I use Tailwind for all my protoyping needs. What I really want to
highlight is this:

<Image src={homelab} alt="homelab" />

What you are looking at is my homelab in its infancy. It is hard to see but underneath the Macbook
is my old 8 year old laptop that houses this very website. That means when you clicked on this very
link, your computer made a request by propagating some abstraction of an electric signal that has
journeyed its way into my home and onto the very laptop that lives underneath my desk. Isn't that
cool!

Although I would love to get technical and take a deep dive into how I went about self-hosting the
site, this won't be the article for that. Instead, as mentioned in my previous
[post](/articles/clickbait-part-1), my goal with these articles is to reflect and try to extract
some useful nuggets of information that students or up and coming developers might find useful
(...or maybe relatable and entertaining).

Most important lesson which isn't anything new: **_build something_**

I'm not yet comfortable to teach the concepts needed to deploy this but at a high level here are the
the things I have learned:

Lesson to all new developers: **_build a portfolio site and put it on the internet, it does not
matter how simple it is_**.

The Lesson... This website was my very first project. As simple as it started out, it has truly
become a fullstack project. It has been through many iterations. It started as something simple but
the more things I learn, I can apply to the website.

The lesson, its natural to want to do complicated projects. Especially with the pressure of trying
to get a job. But I think its important to start with something simple. Something that you can
finish. Something that you can be proud of. Something that you can show off. Something that you can
learn from. Something that you can build on.
