I think I have redone my portfolio website 4 or 5 times. Each iteration is usually fueled by wanting
to learn something new.

<Image src={firstWebsite} alt="first website" />

I can remember creating version 1. It was the portfolio project that any new programmer creates when
they #learn2code. As the image above highlights (_my LinkedIn really needs an update_), it was a
static HTML and CSS site ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) hosted on GitHub Pages since I had
absolutely no idea how to host a website. As simple as this website was, I cannot begin to describe
how pivotal version 1 was in helping me get my first job.

When I started working at my very first software job, I was introduced to
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). Since I was a "real" web developer with a couple of months under my
belt, I had to get with the times and ditch my static website. I began by registering the domain
name _jonathanpark.ca_ and went ahead and converted all the code to React. Getting a little
overzealous, I proceeded to do another refactor to the React derivative framework
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). Now that I had a **domain name** :white_check_mark: and a **shiny
website built with a modern JavaScript framework** :white_check_mark:, it was time for me to move
away from GitHub Pages and deploy all these newly minted changes to the cloud. So I went with the
most user-friendly cloud provider [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

After living off [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) in my first year of coding, I was
motivated to start blogging. Instead of doing the writing that is required to publish a blog, I
needed to create the perfect writing and publishing experience. I am a developer after all, I can't
just use an out of the box solution. This led me to look into "headless" content management systems
(CMS). Think the aesthetics of [Medium](https://medium.com) with the publishing power of
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com) but without all that PHP stuff. There were many different options
but I decided to try out [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). I spent quite a bit of time wiring up my React
site to interface with Ghost... but as expected, I did not end up blogging. When I did write, I came
to the realization I did not need some fancy CMS. I am a developer after all. Markdown, GitHub and
an IDE are all I need :wink:.

Other than some small/irrelevant details in this journey, we are all caught up to present day. The
current version of jonathanpark.ca is the very thing that you are reading this article on. It's
nothing special. It's just a NextJS template from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), which is the
CSS framework I use to make things look nice. From the experience I have gathered, designing
something myself usually drives me crazy so I use Tailwind for all my prototyping needs. What I
really want to highlight is this:

<Image src={homelab} alt="homelab" />

What you are looking at is my homelab in its infancy (_the server rack you can get from ikea for
$20_). It is hard to see but underneath the Macbook is my 8-year-old laptop that houses this very
website. That means when you clicked on the link to this article, your computer made a request by
propagating some abstraction of an electric signal that journeyed its way into my home and onwards
to the very laptop that lives underneath my desk. I think that's pretty damn cool.

Although I would love to get technical and take a deep dive into how I went about self-hosting the
site, this won't be the article for that. Instead, as mentioned in my previous
[post](/articles/clickbait-part-1), my goal with these articles is to reflect and try to extract
some nuggets of information that students or up-and-coming developers might find useful
(...relateable and/or entertaining).

If I were to distill the many lessons I have learned from this website down to the most basic form,
it would be: **_build something simple!_**

This is by far not a revolutionary message. It's a clich√© that can be applied to anything worth
accomplishing. But from a developer's perspective, I would like to emphasize this lesson as I think
my site is a great experiment to prove the point.

As I highlighted above, jonathanpark.ca has been through many iterations. It started as a simple
static portfolio site, which is a great project to begin with when you are learning fundamentals.
**_I built something simple_**. And although I use the term "simple", at the time it was the right
amount of difficulty. I remember every job board I read when searching for that first position
really made me feel like I needed to learn the latest technologies if I was going to be successful.
But how can you learn something like ReactJS if you don't understand basic JavaScript, HTML/CSS, or
even more fundamental, how to host a website?

This site was my very first project and after 4 years it's still something I work on. From it's
primitive inception I have used it as a sandbox to evolve my skills. A laboratory for development.
In its most recent state, jonathanpark.ca has truly become a full-stack application:

- **Fundamental Networking**: Firewalls, VLAN's, DNS, IP/Subnetting, SSL/TLS
- **Virtualization**: Proxmox, Virtual Machines, Containers (_...Kubernetes coming soon_)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Ansible, Terraform, GitOps
- **Application Development**: NextJS (statically and dynamically generated website with an
  ExpressJS server as a backend)

From time to time, when I look at a job board(_...I am happily employed_ :wink:), I am no longer
intimidated by the requirements. I can confidently say that I fulfill all or most of the
requirements with this one project alone!
